Setting Up git repo from local.

a. The command to set it upstream must come once again.
b. My local master branch is not in-track with any remote branch. This is the reason why using normal git push it is asking me to set an upstream default branch for my local branch.
c. Setting up an upstream branch solves the purpose saying that the same branch in the repo will be tracked.
d. After successfully setting up the upstream branch, git push should work.
